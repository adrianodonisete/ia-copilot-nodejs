This rest api needs user authentication.

Users must be able to register (signup) and login.

Don't add any JWT code or anything like that, just generate User models (without using classes) inte models folder.
Also generate signup and login routes (e.g. /users/singup) in the routes folder.
Last but not least, add the code for linking route and model to a users controller in the controllers folder.
Dont add any code for storing user data in a database yet.
